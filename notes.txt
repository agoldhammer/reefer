run npx http-server in resources/public directory to start server on 8080

I tested several approaches
and logged the results here
https://github.com/filipesilva/calva-testing (edited) 
that repo can be used to test
on calva's side, the test commands don't work on cljs: https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/issues/311 (edited) 
on shadow cljs's side two bad interactions happen with calvas repl window
- the test output isn't shown for node repls (https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs/issues/373)
- running a test build without autoron and with node-repl fails to load the namespace https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs/issues/587 (edited) 

karma testing:
karma start karma.conf.js --single-run
karma.conf.js file modified as indicated
